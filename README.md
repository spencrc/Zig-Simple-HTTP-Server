## Book Reference
https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/Chapters/04-http-server.html

## Building & Running
Using Zig 0.15.2, you can build the project
```
zig build
```
This will produce an executable. You can run the executable itself, or build and run the project with
```
zig build run
```

## Note
The majority of this project, as of writing, is not my own code. I am using this project to help me learn Zig. The goal is to create a fully functional HTTP server, and to share this repository as a resource for those interested in learning Zig and creating HTTP servers within Zig.

Please see the book reference above for the original author, or any linked repositories in specific files to see where specific code originates from.
